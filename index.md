## About Me

I'm an AI Ph.D. candidate in the joint program between <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> and <a href="https://www.eitech.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Eastern Institute of Technology, Ningbo</a>. I am supervised by  Prof.<a href="https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?tid=31&p=teacher" target="_blank"> Yuntian Chen </a> (belonging to the team of Prof.<a href="https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?p=teacher&tid=63" target="_blank"> Dongxiao Zhang </a> and guided by Prof.<a href="https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?tid=3&p=teacher" target="_blank"> Shiyi Chen </a>) and Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yDEavdMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank"> Xiaokang Yang </a>, and I also work closely with  Prof.<a href="https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Chao Ma </a>.

Prior to that, I  received my B.E. and M.S. degrees from <a href="https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Northwestern Polytechnical University</a> respectively in 2019 and 2022, under the supervision of Pro.<a href="https://scholar.google.ae/citations?user=xrqsoesAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank"> Junwei Han </a>, and also working closely with Pro.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XqrlEUoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Xiwen Yao </a>.  My research centers on **data-limited and domain-aware visual learning**. I am particularly interested in how **prior knowledge**, **task structure**, and **foundation models** can be systematically integrated to build **generalizable and trustworthy vision systems** under limited supervision. My recent work explores **few-shot and open-vocabulary segmentation**, **prompt learning**, and **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)**, with applications across **remote sensing**, **medical imaging**, and broader **AI for Science** scenarios.
More broadly, I study core vision problems including **segmentation, classification, super-resolution, and generative modeling**, to enable reliable visual intelligence for scientific and real-world decision-making.
